## Datasets

The Movement Explorer app requires three input files: one containing animal movement data, the second identifying seasonal and migration periods, and the third disturbances and conservation areas. All required attribute and layer names are highlighted in bold letters.

### Input 1: Animal movement data

Format:
- Text file - comma separated values (".csv")

Required attributes:
- **id**: Individual identification e.g., collar id
- **time**: a timestamp indicating the year, month, day, hour, minute, second
- **long**: longitude (crs:4326)
- **lat**: latitude (crs:4326)
- **elev**: elevation in metres

Any additional variables will be loaded and can be viewed but will not be used in any of the analyses. 

### Input 2: Seasonal and migration periods

Format:
- Text file - comma separated values (".csv")

Required attributes:
- **season**: name of season or migration period
- **start**: start date in month-day format e.g., Jun-16
- **end**: end date in month-day format e.g., Sep-14

Example table:

<pre>
|season           |start  |end    |
|-----------------|-------|-------|
|Annual           |Jan-01 |Dec-31 |
|Early winter     |Oct-21 |Jan-31 |
|Late winter      |Feb-01 |Apr-15 |
|Summer           |Jun-16 |Sep-14 |
|Fall rut         |Sep-15 |Oct-20 |
|Spring migration |Apr-01 |Jun-30 |
|Fall migration   |Sep-01 |Oct-31 |
</pre>

### Input 3: Disturbances and conservation areas

The third input can be generated from the Geopackage Creator app.

Format: 
- Geopackage file (".gpkg")

Required layers:

- **studyarea**: boundary of study region (polygon)
- **linear_disturbance**: anthropogenic linear disturbances (lines)
- **areal_disturbance**: anthropogenic areal disturbances (polygons)
- **fire**: fire polygons (polygons)
- **footprint_500m**: combined linear and areal disturbances buffered by 500m (polygon)
- **protected_areas**: protected and conserved areas, including IPCAs (polygons)
