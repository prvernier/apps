## Welcome to the Movement Explorer

Understanding how animals use space and migrate is crucial for conservation and for understanding the effects of environmental changes. The BEACONs Movement Explorer is a simple app intended to be used as part of a workflow for exploring movement data. Specifically, the app can help users to:

  - Visualize animal locations and trajectories
  - Summarize GPS-based sampling characteristics
  - Define seasonal and migration periods
  - Estimate annual and seasonal ranges
  - Identify seasonal movement corridors (paths)

Please note that the Movement Explorer app is intended to provide users with a simple way to visualize movement data and explore patterns e.g., movement corridors and high use areas. It is not intended to be used for data preparation and cleaning, nor for complex statistical analysis and modelling.
