## Help: Define segments

This section of the app allows the user to view the distribution of animal relocations for different seasons and migration periods and, optionally, to modify the start and end points of each season or period. Users can also save results at anytime to a CSV file.

### Plots

There are five plots.

**Latitude vs Longitude**

The "Latitude vs. Longitude" plot on the left describes the geographical area an individual animal for one or more years. Each point on the plot represents a specific location where an animal was observed, tagged, or recorded. The x-axis typically represents longitude (east-west position relative to the Prime Meridian) and the y-axis represents latitude (north-south position relative to the Equator).

**Longitude vs Day of year**

The "Longitude vs. Day of year" plot describes the movement of an individual animal from east to west over the course of a year. Rapid movements are indicated by sharp upward or downward slopes while more sedentary behaviour are indicated by the flatter portions of the plot.

**Latitude vs Day of year**

The "Latitude vs. Day of year" plot describes the movement of an individual animal from north to south over the course of a year. Rapid movements are indicated by sharp upward or downward slopes while more sedentary behaviour are indicated by the flatter portions of the plot.

**NSD vs Day of year**

The "NSD vs. Day of year" plot describes the **Net Squared Displacement (NSD)** of an individual animal over the course of a year. NSD is a measure of how far an animal has moved from its initial starting point. It is measured as the square of the straight-line distance between the animal's first recorded location and each subsequent location. So, at any given time, NSD represents the squared straight-line distance from the very beginning of the tracking period.

**Elevation vs Day of year**

The "Elevation vs. Day of year" plot describes the movement of an individual animal along an elevation gradient over the course of a year.
